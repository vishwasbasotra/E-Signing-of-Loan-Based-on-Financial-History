# E-Signing of Loan Based on Financial History ANN
The loan is one of the most important products of the banking. All the banks are trying to figure out effective business strategies to persuade customers to apply their loans. However, there are some customers behave negatively after their application are approved. To prevent this situation, banks have to find some methods to predict customersâ€™ behaviours. Machine learning algorithms have a pretty good performance on this purpose, which are widely-used by the banking. Here, I will work on loan behaviours prediction using machine learning models.
